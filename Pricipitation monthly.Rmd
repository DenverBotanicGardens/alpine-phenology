options(prism.path = "Q:/Research/All_Projects_by_Species/aa_Shapefiles_Maps/aa_QGIS Projects/Alpine Phenology Project/MonthlyMEDL")


get_prism_monthlys(type="ppt", years=1950:2011, mon = c(1:9), keepZip=FALSE)

precips <- grep("ppt", ls_prism_data(absPath=TRUE)[,2])

monthly.precip <- lapply()

```
