From Q:\Reserach\Plant Lists\
Data to subset
```{r}
#too big for getting from GitHub
#colo <- read.csv(text = getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DenverBotanicGardens/alpine-phenology/master/Complete COLO DB .csv")) 
colo <- read.csv("P:/hackathon/alpine-phenology/Complete COLO DB .csv") 


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
